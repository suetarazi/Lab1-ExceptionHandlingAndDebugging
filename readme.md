# Exception Handling and Debugging

Author: Sue Tarazi

Description
This is a C# console application that is a math game for the user, but utilizes lots of error handling. The user inputs an array length, then populates the array with numbers. Sum and product are then calculated. The user is queried again for another number and the quotient is then returned.
